# SourceMod Scripts

Addon scripts for SourceMod (https://www.sourcemod.net/), primarily for CSGO.

### Xtense Suite
The Xtense suite is developped primarily for CS:GO Jailbreak server types. It is developed in a modular, lightweight way to allow server owners to pick and choose exactly what features they want on their server without overloading on unnecessary plugins.
- xtense_consoledeaths
  - Console deaths displays deaths in each players console, similar to that in CS:S. The death displays as "Attacker killed Victim with Weapon", e.g. "Bob killed Fred with weapon_ak47"
